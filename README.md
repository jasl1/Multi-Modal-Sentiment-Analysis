# Multi-Modal-Sentiment-Analysis
In this, project we develop a sentiment analysis model to predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of movie reviews. We'll create a sentiment analysis model for movie reviews using RNN/LSTM, deploy it on AWS, manage the codebase with Git, and utilize multi-modal analysis by combining text data with metadata like genre or release year.

### Dataset: We'll use the IMDB movie review dataset, which contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

### Tools and Libraries:

1. RNN/LSTM: TensorFlow or PyTorch for building the sentiment analysis model.
2. AWS: Deploy the model on AWS Lambda for serverless inference.
3. Git: Version control for managing the project codebase.
4. Multi-Modal: Combine text data with metadata like genre or release year.
