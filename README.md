# Multi-Modal-Sentiment-Analysis
In this, project we develop a multi-modal sentiment analysis model to predict the sentiment (positive/negative) of movie reviews. We'll create a sentiment analysis model for movie reviews using RNN/LSTM, deploy it on AWS, manage the codebase with Git, and utilize multi-modal analysis by combining text data with metadata like genre or release year.

### Dataset: 
We'll use the IMDB movie review dataset, which contains movie reviews labeled as positive or negative.

### Tools and Libraries:

1. RNN/LSTM: TensorFlow or PyTorch for building the sentiment analysis model.
2. AWS: Deploy the model on AWS Lambda for serverless inference.
3. Git: Version control for managing the project codebase.
4. Multi-Modal: Combine text data with metadata like genre or release year.


### Data Collection: 
Gather the IMDB movie review dataset along with metadata like genre and release year. This step ensures we have the necessary data to train the sentiment analysis model.

### Data Preprocessing: 
Clean and preprocess the text data by tokenizing, removing stopwords, and converting to lowercase. Encode the sentiment labels into numerical values and combine text data with metadata for multi-modal analysis.

### Model Development: 
Design and train an RNN/LSTM model for sentiment analysis using TensorFlow or PyTorch. This model will learn to predict whether a movie review is positive or negative based on the text data.

### Model Evaluation: 
Evaluate the performance of the trained model using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation ensures that the model's performance is consistent across different subsets of the data.

### Deployment on AWS: 
Deploy the trained model on AWS Lambda for serverless inference. Expose an endpoint for making predictions, allowing users to input movie reviews and receive sentiment predictions in real-time.

### Version Control with Git: 
Use Git for version control to track changes to the codebase, collaborate with team members, and manage new features or bug fixes efficiently.

By following these steps, we can create a multi-modal sentiment analysis project that incorporates RNN/LSTM models on the AWS platform.
